This is Random Lottery Numbers Generator

It consist of 2 projects, project with core logic and tests project for random numbers generation testing

It was written with VS 2019, so target .Net is 5.0. I avoid to use C# features newer than v6.0 just to keep code simple

This is console app

So, some features, that might be improved
1. Make separete view class
2. Controllers are not actually controllers, it is services, so make separate controllers
3. Add some additional tests, for example, check is the generated numbers sorted
4. Currently there is no real reason to have interfaces, but I prefer to use it for future generations of developers
5. May be add some comments... but I named everything the best understandable way, so, I hope, my code is readable enough

Now I thing it would be easier to write something like MVC or MVVM using WPF, but this one works, and thats nice

I also added a screenshot and an exe file to be sure this all works on your machine

Time spent around 1.55h incluiding this message and pushing repo
